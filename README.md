# Terrible but incredible

## Running locally

Needed:

- Docker
- API key for https://www.themoviedb.org/

Running:

```sh
yarn
yarn dx
```

Yarn seeds will run on start but they may fail a couple of times as it's going through all the movies so you can you run it several times and it will skip movies already in the DB
